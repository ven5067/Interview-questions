## Use Case: Design a RESTful API for a social media platform like Twitter.

**Approach:**

- **Entities:** Define core entities like User, Tweet, Comment, Follower.
- **Endpoints:** Design endpoints for operations such as user registration, tweeting, commenting, following/unfollowing users, fetching user timeline, etc.
- **Security:** Implement OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, rate limiting for API usage.
- **Scalability:** Use caching (e.g., Redis) for hot data, sharding for databases, CDN for media storage.
- **Monitoring:** Include metrics (using Spring Boot Actuator) for API performance and health.

## Use Case: Design a job scheduling system like Cron with REST API endpoints.

**Approach:**

- **Job Definition:** Define a Job entity with attributes like schedule, command to execute, parameters.
- **Endpoints:** Implement endpoints for CRUD operations on jobs, triggering jobs manually, retrieving job status, and logs.
- **Scheduler:** Use Quartz Scheduler or Spring @Scheduled tasks for job execution.
- **Concurrency:** Handle concurrent job execution and ensure jobs are idempotent.
- **Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring for job execution status and errors.

## Use Case: Design an online bookstore application with inventory management and order processing.

**Approach:**

- **Entities:** Define entities like Book, Author, Order, Customer.
- **Endpoints:** Implement endpoints for browsing books, placing orders, viewing order history, managing inventory, etc.
- **Payment Integration:** Integrate with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for secure transactions.
- **Shipping:** Implement shipping APIs or integrate with shipping services for order fulfillment.
- **Security:** Secure user data and transactions using HTTPS, authentication, and authorization.
- **Scalability:** Use distributed caching (e.g., Redis) for inventory management, load balancing for high traffic.

## Use Case: Design a collaborative document editing platform like Google Docs.

**Approach:**

- **Real-time Collaboration:** Use WebSockets (e.g., using Spring WebSocket) for real-time updates.
- **Document Model:** Define a Document entity with content, users collaborating, permissions.
- **Endpoints:** Implement endpoints for creating/editing documents, sharing documents, tracking changes, etc.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Implement operational transformation or CRDT for resolving conflicts in real-time edits.
- **Version Control:** Implement versioning for documents to track changes and revert if needed.
- **Scalability:** Use distributed database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) for storing documents, handle concurrent edits efficiently.

---

## Use Case: Design a notification service for a mobile app with push notifications.

**Approach:**

- **Notification Types:** Define types such as push notifications, in-app messages, emails.
- **Endpoints:** Implement endpoints for sending notifications to specific users or user groups.
- **Message Queuing:** Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for handling notification delivery asynchronously.
- **Integration:** Integrate with third-party services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or APNS for push notifications.
- **Personalization:** Allow customization of notifications based on user preferences and behavior.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for notification delivery status, errors, and user engagement.

---

## Key Considerations for All Use Cases:

- **Scalability:** Ensure the design can handle increasing user base and data volume.
- **Reliability:** Plan for fault tolerance, error handling, and disaster recovery.
- **Security:** Implement data encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
- **Performance:** Optimize for performance with efficient data storage, caching, and query optimization.
- **Maintainability:** Design with modularity and clean architecture principles to facilitate future enhancements and changes.
