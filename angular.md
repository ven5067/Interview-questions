## Explain the Angular Injector and how it works.

The Injector in Angular is a mechanism for dependency injection that allows components, services, and other parts of the application to request dependencies at runtime. Angular creates an Injector tree, where each component can have its own injector. When a dependency is requested, Angular starts the search from the component's injector and moves up the tree until it finds the provider. This allows for hierarchical injection, meaning child components can override dependencies provided by parent components.

## How does Angular's AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation improve performance?

AOT compilation converts Angular HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the build process, before the browser downloads and runs the code. This results in faster rendering because the browser loads precompiled code. AOT also reduces the size of the application bundle by removing Angular decorators, improves security by compiling templates and expressions, and catches template errors early, which leads to better performance and error handling.

## What are Angular zones, and how do they relate to change detection?

Zones in Angular, implemented via the zone.js library, are a mechanism to detect and track asynchronous operations such as HTTP requests, setTimeout, and promises. Angular uses zones to know when to trigger change detection. When an asynchronous operation completes, Angular automatically runs change detection to update the view. NgZone allows you to run code inside or outside Angular's zone, which can be used to optimize performance by limiting unnecessary change detection cycles.

## Describe the purpose and use of Angular Guards.

Angular Guards are used to control navigation in an Angular application. They can prevent unauthorized access to routes or perform checks before a route is activated or deactivated.

## Explain Angular's Dependency Injection (DI) mechanism. How does Angular resolve dependencies?

Angular's DI mechanism is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), allowing Angular to resolve and inject dependencies into components, services, and other classes. Dependencies are provided by providers, which can be registered in various scopes (e.g., module, component). Angular resolves dependencies using a hierarchical injector system, starting from the component's injector and moving up to the root injector. The @Injectable decorator is used to declare a class as a service that can be injected. When a class requests a dependency, Angular creates and injects the required instance if it doesn't already exist, ensuring singleton services across the application unless explicitly overridden.

## How does Angular's change detection mechanism work?

Angular's change detection mechanism involves checking for changes in component data and updating the view accordingly. It uses zones to monitor asynchronous operations and triggers change detection when these operations complete. Angular provides two change detection strategies:

- Default: Checks every component's bindings for changes.
- OnPush: Only checks when an input property changes or an event occurs within the component. The ChangeDetectorRef service can be used to manually trigger or detach change detection. By optimizing change detection with `ngZone.runOutsideAngular()`, developers can improve performance by avoiding unnecessary checks.

## What is Angular Ivy? How does it improve the framework's performance?

Angular Ivy is the latest rendering engine introduced in Angular 9, aimed at improving the performance and maintainability of Angular applications. Ivy offers several benefits:

- Smaller Bundle Sizes: By using tree-shaking techniques, Ivy eliminates unused code, reducing the final bundle size.
- Faster Compilation: Ivy improves build times and incremental compilation, making the development experience smoother.
- Better Debugging: The generated code is more readable and easier to debug.
- Improved AOT: Enhancements in AOT compilation provide faster rendering and improved runtime performance.

## Describe the Angular module system. How does it differ from JavaScript ES6 modules?

Angular modules, defined using @NgModule, organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They group related components, directives, pipes, and services, making it easier to manage and scale applications. Key properties of @NgModule include:

- Declarations: Components, directives, and pipes belonging to the module.
- Imports: Other modules whose exported components are needed.
- Exports: Components, directives, and pipes made available to other modules.
- Providers: Services available throughout the module.
- Bootstrap: The root component of the application. Unlike ES6 modules that focus on importing/exporting JavaScript functionalities, Angular modules manage the application's structure, dependencies, and components.

## How does Angular handle form validation?

Angular supports two types of form validation: template-driven and reactive forms.

- Template-Driven Forms: Use directives to bind data and validation to the template. Validators are added using Angular directives like `required` and `minlength`.
- Reactive Forms: Provide a more programmatic approach. Developers create form controls and groups using `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormArray`. Validators are functions applied directly to form controls or groups. Both approaches support built-in validators (`required`, `minlength`, etc.) and custom validators. Reactive forms offer more control and flexibility, making them suitable for complex scenarios.

## What are Angular decorators and how do they work internally?

Angular decorators are functions that add metadata to classes, making them suitable for use within the framework. Key decorators include:

- @Component: Defines a component.
- @Directive: Defines a directive.
- @Pipe: Defines a pipe.
- @Injectable: Marks a class as available for DI. Internally, decorators attach metadata to classes using the Reflect API. Angular's compiler reads this metadata to generate the necessary code for components, directives, and services at runtime.

## What are Angular lifecycle hooks? Describe their use and sequence.

Angular lifecycle hooks allow developers to tap into specific moments in a component's lifecycle. Key hooks include:

- ngOnInit: Called once after the first ngOnChanges, used for initialization.
- ngOnChanges: Called when input properties change.
- ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run.
- ngAfterContentInit: Called once after content (ng-content) has been projected into the view.
- ngAfterContentChecked: Called after every check of projected content.
- ngAfterViewInit: Called once after the component's view and child views have been initialized.
- ngAfterViewChecked: Called after every check of the component's view and child views.
- ngOnDestroy: Called just before the component is destroyed, used for cleanup. The sequence allows developers to manage initialization, change detection, and cleanup efficiently.

## How does Angular routing work?

Angular's router enables navigation between views or components based on URL paths. Configuration is done via RouterModule:

- Routes: Define paths and associated components.
- Lazy Loading: Defers loading of feature modules until needed, optimizing performance.
- Guards: Control access to routes (e.g., CanActivate, CanDeactivate).
- RouterLink: Directive to create links within templates.
- Router Outlet: Directive that acts as a placeholder for routed components. Guards like CanActivate prevent navigation to a route unless conditions are met, enhancing security and control.

## What is Angular Universal? Explain its benefits and how it works.

Angular Universal enables server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications, improving performance and SEO. It works by rendering Angular components on the server before sending the HTML to the client. Benefits include:

- Faster Initial Load: Pre-rendered pages load quickly, enhancing user experience.
- SEO Optimization: Search engines can crawl and index pre-rendered content more effectively.
- Improved Performance: Less JavaScript to execute on the client side. Angular Universal integrates with Node.js, where the server renders Angular components and serves the resulting HTML.

## How does Angular handle HTTP requests and responses?

Angular's HttpClientModule provides a robust HTTP client for making HTTP requests. Key features include:

- HttpClient: Simplifies HTTP requests with methods like `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete`.
- Interceptors: Intercept requests and responses to modify or handle them globally (e.g., adding authentication tokens, logging, error handling).
- Observables: Uses RxJS Observables for handling asynchronous data, offering powerful operators for transformation and error handling.
- Error Handling: Provides mechanisms to catch and handle errors using RxJS `catchError` operator.
- Typed Responses: Supports strongly typed responses for better type safety and intellisense.
